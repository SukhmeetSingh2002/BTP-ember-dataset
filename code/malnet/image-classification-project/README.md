# Image Classification Project

This project implements an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on a dataset of images belonging to different classes.

## Project Structure

The project has the following files and directories:

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the project.
  - `cnn_model.py`: This file contains the implementation of the CNN model for image classification. It includes functions to define the architecture of the model, train the model, and make predictions.
  - `data_loader.py`: This file contains the implementation of the data loader. It includes functions to load and preprocess the images from the specified directories. The images are classified based on the directory names.
  - `main.py`: This file is the main entry point of the project. It imports the CNN model and data loader, and it trains the model using the loaded data.
  - `utils.py`: This file contains utility functions that are used in the project, such as functions for data preprocessing and evaluation.

- `data/`: This directory contains the image data for classification. Each subdirectory corresponds to a class, and the images inside each subdirectory belong to that class.

- `models/`: This directory is intended to store the trained models. After training, the model will be saved in this directory for future use.

- `results/`: This directory is intended to store the results of the image classification, such as accuracy metrics and evaluation reports.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the required Python packages and their versions for running the project. You can use this file to install the dependencies using `pip`.

## Usage

To run the image classification code, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Place your image data in the `data/` directory. Each subdirectory should correspond to a class, and the images inside each subdirectory should belong to that class.

3. Open the `src/main.py` file and modify the code according to your specific requirements. You may need to adjust the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training settings.

4. Run the `main.py` file to start the training process:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```

5. After training, the model will be saved in the `models/` directory. You can use this trained model for making predictions on new images.

6. To evaluate the model on the test set or new images, you can modify the code in `main.py` or create a separate evaluation script using the trained model.

## Results

The results of the image classification, such as accuracy metrics and evaluation reports, will be stored in the `results/` directory.
